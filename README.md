# SeniorProject24-PiPlayer
We made a Raspberry Pi record player for Spotify for our senior project. In the digital age of music, streaming services like Spotify are the most popular form of music listening today. With this device, we aimed to bring back a tangible relationship with music. It also offers quicker access to people’s favorite music which is beneficial for people that listen to a lot of music daily. 

## Description
Our goal was to create a customizable record player that’s easy to use. The “records” are RFID tags that the user can scan as an album or a playlist, and they’re able to play it through speakers connected to the Raspberry Pi. This project is a proof of concept.
